- Want to allow multiple args? b(".bar", divNode).append('<div></div>'). That implies
append specifying it want automatic type conversion of the args, but is it better
just to say create new blades?

- Create blade/bind that is just es5 bind/dojo.hitch, but should be better to type
to allow setting "this" object first: bind(this, "func") or bind(this, function(){})
