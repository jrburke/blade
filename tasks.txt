- Want to allow multiple args? b(".bar", divNode).append('<div></div>'). That implies
append specifying it want automatic type conversion of the args, but is it better
just to say create new blades?

Promises are about calling functions and getting the return value without blocking other events, even if there is high latency.

There's a common misconception that Promises are about turning functions into functions that get called later.

Use cases for the API
Short API spec, one page
How many things to I have to learn to use the API?
mimic patterns of core apis
immutable favored
subclass only when is-a relationship, otherwise use composition: Properties exends Hashtable, really just has-a.
document for inheritence or prohibit it. Inheritance violates encapsulation. Exactly how every method uses each other method.
when in doubt leave it out
don't make client do things framework could do: reduce need for boilerplate code.
Principle of least astonishment
fail fast
programmatic API for string values: otherwise string format becomes a string format
overload with care, just give it another name.
consistent parameter order across methods: no more than three, avoid same types
favor zero length array vs. null
